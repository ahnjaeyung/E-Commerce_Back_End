## Installation  
Clone repo and npm i  
## Usage  
To begin, the user must first create the database using mysql (*source schema.sql*).  After creating the database (*ecommerce_db*), the user can seed the tables in the database by running *npm run seed* in their command line.  This application is launched through the command line ("node server.js").  

The user can then use the API *GET*, *POST*, *PUT*, and *DELETE* routes to view, create, update, or delete categories, tags, and products in their database.
